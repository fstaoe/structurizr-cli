# Local installation

1. Download the Structurizr CLI from [https://static.structurizr.com/download/structurizr-cli.zip](https://static.structurizr.com/download/structurizr-cli.zip), and unzip. You will need Java (version 11+) installed, and available to use from your command line (__please note that the CLI does not work with Java versions 11.0.0-11.0.3__).
2. Unzip into a directory of your choice.
3. Add the directory to your operating system's path (optional).
